How do I enable the commands?
This requires a database. Currently, only MySQL is tested and known to work, although other databases probably work as well.
1) Download the MySQLConnector/J package: http://www.mysql.com/products/connector/j/
2) Create a folder named 'lib'
3) Add mysql-connector-java-X.X.X-ga-bin.jar to the lib folder
4) Edit settings.ini; set enableCommands=true, and add the following (edit accordingly)
[database]
schema=schema.mysql
driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
url=jdbc:mysql://[host]:3306/[database]
username=[username]
password=[password]
